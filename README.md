#RUN THE Project by url "https://reetika12.github.io/"
#Project is running as static file only html, css, javascript
#Can be run by running index.html
# I have added searchbar in the header part  to search based on title.
# I have added add button to add the note(condition is both should be non empty)
# Used localstorage to store the data of notes so that we dont lose data after refresh.
# Delete button on each card that will remove the data of card from local storage.
# used drop down to list the colors this can be done in a better way due to lack of time only its providing color on our input part of add note field.
